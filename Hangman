'''
Cows and bulls game:
Generate a 4 digit number and ask the user to guess what the number is.
For every correct number the user gets a 'cow' for every correct number in the wrong place the user gets a 'bull'
The program then tells the user how many 'cows' and 'bulls' until the number is guessed.
The program also keeps track of the users guessses via counter (and maybe checks for doubl).
